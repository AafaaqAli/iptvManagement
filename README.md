# iptvManagement
Android application for TV that allows managing lists of IPTV channels


This repository contains the code of an Android TV application capable of managing lists of IPTV channels. These lists must be in M3U and M3U8 format and with the structure that defines this type of files.
It also manages EPG lists that are in the XMLTV format.

The application is written almost entirely using Kotlin with the exception of some classes that are in Java. It uses the Realm IO library for persistence.


## Utilization:
Download the master branch, compile and have fun. Or you can also use the apk file that is in the file and that is exactly the compilation of the latest version of the master branch that exists.


## Status of the application.

This application is in development to continue adding more functionalities, and improvements in the code, all the feedback is welcome and of course any contribution of code.
